These Matlab scripts are used to process ROMS_AGRIF output files, with the aim of being used in 
the Alavai application.

If you intend to adapt Alavai to your own configuration, you will need to modify these scripts
to your convenience. However, we provide them to help you in this task. These scripts also clarify
the preprocessing part of Alavai.

Here it is a brief description of the steps that we perform in our operational configuration, that
hopefully, will help you to understand this process:

1) Everyday, our ROMS_AGRIF configuration is executed generating one file per day. We use meteorological
predictions from the WRF model executed by an external institution.

2) We obtain 4 files, one for today and the others for the 3-day horizon forecast. These files store
hourly data.

3) ROMS history files are converted in CF-Complaint by using roms2cf_geopotential.m
In the horizontal, this script reinterpolates "u" and "v" velocities to rho_points. 
In the vertical, data are interpolated to constant depths.

4) ROMS CF-Complaint files are uploaded to our thredds. 

5) We combine ROMS CF-Complaint and WRF files to create a drift file to use in Alavai. See the script roms2drift.m
One file contains exclusively the surface currents (1m depth) and it is named Raia_drift_passive.nc
Another file contains the same information plus 3% of the wind speed and it is named Radia_drift_oil.nc

6) The drift files are uploaded to the Thredds server, where the "Alavai" application will connect for getting data.
